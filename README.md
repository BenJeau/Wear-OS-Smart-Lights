# WearOS-Smart-Lights
My first Wear OS application which is a standalone application that controls TP-Link smart plugs while being connected to the Internet. It uses a RecyclerView to populate the children in the list.

## Screenshots
The screenshot is from a circle watch, but looks weird now with the black on black with the background. This will be fixed eventually.
